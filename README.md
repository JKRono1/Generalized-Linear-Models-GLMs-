# Generalized Linear Models(GLMs)

The normal distribution plays a central role when making inference for Ordinary linear regression models.These models assume that the response variable y follows the normal distribution.

In some practical situations however,the response variable may be a discrete variable, such as count of events.Another possibility is the binary response variable where the response variable is either success or failure (i.e., 0 or 1,yes or No). 

GLMs are often better models than ordinary linear regression models.They allow us to fit regression models for response data whose response variable Y, follow the exponential family of distributions. The exponential family of distributions include the normal, binomial, Poisson, geometric, negative binomial, exponential, gamma, and inverse normal distributions.

The usual GLMs assumes that the observations are independent, when this assumption is violated, it is appropriate to fit Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for a correlation structure between observations

Two very important members of the family of generalized linear models are logistic regression and Poisson regression. They both find extensive application in biological, biomedical, and environmental problems.
